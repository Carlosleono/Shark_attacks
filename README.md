## **OVERVIEW**
#
### In this project we are going to analyze a dataset that includes information about shark attacks in the world, including: date, country, sex, age, shark species, activity, fatality and others.

### The objective of this project is to make some hyphotesis, clean the dataset (clean.ipynb) and verify those hyphotesis by using differents plot techniques (analysis.ipynb).
#
## **HYPOTHESIS**
#
### 1. The fatality rate in the last 150 years has descended more in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern one. This could be due to the difference in wealth between the hemispheres.
### 2. The average age of the victims has increase in the last century. 
### 3. White shark attacks are the deadliest
